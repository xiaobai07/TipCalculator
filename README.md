TipCalculator Demo
=============
Time spent: 6 hours spent in total

Completed user stories:

Required: Creating the Tip Calculator

Required: Adding Tip Calculator Settings Page

Optional: view animations 

Optional: Remember the bill amount across app restarts. After an extended period of time, clear the state. This is a UI trick             that Apple uses with the Spotlight app. If you return there a minute later, it will show your most recent search. if            you return 10 minutes later, it defaults to blank. To implement this, plug into the application lifecycle and track             time using NSDate.

Optional: Use locale specific currency and currency thousands separators.

Optional: Add a light/dark color theme to the settings view. In viewWillAppear, update views with the correct theme colors.

Notes:
Add a feature so that swipe left can delete the last number of the bill amout.
